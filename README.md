# NoOfPositiveCasesAgainstTested_COVID19

Goal of this project is to find out which state is doing test efficiently. Now we are not sure what kind of strategy each states are adopting.
But effectiveness of testing are apparent from the number of postive cases get detected.
So here analysis is made on number of postive cases against number of tested.
Which state is able to get higher number of positive cases against the number of tested, can be said has more efficient method/strategy of testing.
Same strategy can be implemented by rest of state to track the infected people faster so that they can be isolated sooner to avoid to spread the virus to more people.
There by number cases eventually could be controlled.

Data of August is taken for this project.
